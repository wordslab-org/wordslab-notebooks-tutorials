# Wordslab notebooks Tutorials

## Wordslab notebooks overview

Wordslab notebooks installs all the tools you need to **learn, explore and build AI applications on your own machine**.

- Recent and compatible versions of the  best open source tools
- Optimized work environment to save disk space and memory
- Options to leverage your own machines at home or to rent more powerful machines in the cloud 
- Documentation to guide you in your AI learning and exploration journey
    
It provides 3 main applications

- A rich chat interface (text, images, voice) : Open WebUI
- A notebooks platform (text & code) : JupyterJab + Jupyter AI extension 
- A development environment (code) : Visual Studio Code + Continue.dev extension + Aider terminal agent

And a ready to use and fully integrated AI environment with

- A visual dashboard to help you navigate all applications and manage your machine resources
- Optimized inference engines to run AI models : Ollama + vLLM

Why use this instead of a popular cloud services like ChatGPT ou Gemini ?

- Free solution with no rate limits if you already own a powerful machine
- Confidentiality and privacy of your data and projects
- Choose what tools and models you install and when you upgrade
- Understand how AI works and build your own solutions 

You should first read the complete documentation to install and start Wordslab notebooks:

## Examples of machine learning and deep learning applications

When you create a new project in the Wordslab notebooks workspace, the most common datascience librairies are preinstalled on your machine and ready to use.

Here are minimal examples that illustrate how to use them.

### Machine learning - Scikit-learn and Pandas

- data-science-tutorials/[03_machine-learning_scikit-learn-pandas-example.ipynb](data-science-tutorials/03_machine-learning_scikit-learn-pandas-example.ipynb)

  - Use pandas to load and vizualize a dataset
  - Use scikit-learn to train a decision tree
  - Use matplotlib to plot the results

### Deep learning - Fastai and PyTorch

- data-science-tutorials/[04_deep_learning_pytorch-fastai-example.ipynb](data-science-tutorials/04_deep_learning_pytorch-fastai-example.ipynb)

  - Use fastai to train an image classifier

### Natural Language Processing - Spacy and Gradio

- data-science-tutorials/[05_nlp_gradio-spacy-example.ipynb](data-science-tutorials/05_nlp_gradio-spacy-example.ipynb)

  - Use spacy to analyze the grammatical structure of a sentence
  - Use gradio to create an interactive web app around this function
