    "## Step 2 - Understand the main concepts of Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter Notebooks provide a powerful and flexible environment for interactive computing. \n",
    "- Immediate Feedback: Execute code and see results instantly.\n",
    "- Variable Inspection: View and modify variables in real-time.\n",
    "- Visualizations: Create and display plots and charts directly in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "Their ability to combine code execution, rich text formatting, and multimedia output makes them an invaluable tool for data scientists, researchers, educators, and anyone working with data. \n",
    "\n",
    "By understanding the core concepts and features of Jupyter Notebooks, users can leverage their full potential to enhance productivity and collaboration in data-driven projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What Jupyter Notebooks are\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebooks are interactive documents that mix executable code, narrative text, equations, visualizations, and outputs in a single file. They are widely used for data analysis, machine learning, scientific computing, education, and reproducible research.\n",
    "- Originally the name “Jupyter” comes from Julia, Python, and R, three popular languages for data analysis, but the platform now supports many other languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to choose notebooks vs. scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebooks excel at interactive exploration, visualization, teaching, and communication.\n",
    "- Scripts or packages are better for production pipelines, libraries, and complex testing.\n",
    "- A healthy pattern is to explore in notebooks, extract stable code into modules, then call those modules from notebooks.\n",
    "- https://nbdev.fast.ai/ is preinstalled in Wordslab notebooks to support this workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "### Core pieces of the system\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebook file (.ipynb): A JSON document containing cells (code, Markdown), their outputs, and metadata. It’s human-readable through tools, not by hand.\n",
    "- Kernel: The process that runs your code (e.g., Python via IPython). Each notebook connects to one kernel at a time.\n",
    "- Client interface: The app you use to edit and run notebooks (JupyterLab, VS Code, etc.).\n",
    "- Jupyter Server: Serves the notebook UI in your browser and manages kernels. Runs locally or remotely.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interfaces you can use\n",
    "\n",
    "- JupyterLab: A modern, flexible environment with a file browser, terminals, text editors, consoles, and extensions. Recommended for most users.\n",
    "- Classic Notebook: The original, simpler interface.\n",
    "- Other options: VS Code and PyCharm integrate with Jupyter; hosted services include Google Colab, Kaggle, CoCalc, and enterprise JupyterHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  Cells: building blocks of a notebook\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code cells: Hold executable code for the active kernel. Outputs appear directly below the cell (text, tables, plots, images, HTML, etc.).\n",
    "- Markdown cells: Hold formatted text, lists, links, images, and math (LaTeX syntax). Use them to explain ideas, document methods, and present results.\n",
    "- Execution count: Each run increments an “In [ ]” counter. The order matters for state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### The execution model and state\n",
    "\n",
    "- Statefulness: Variables and imports live in the kernel’s memory until you restart it. Running cells out of order can produce confusing results.\n",
    "- Restart and Run All: Use this to ensure the notebook executes cleanly from top to bottom.\n",
    "- Interrupt vs. restart: Interrupt stops a long-running cell; restart wipes all memory and starts fresh.\n",
    "- Long-running tasks: You can let a cell run while you edit others, but be mindful of shared state.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Working effectively with cells\n",
    "\n",
    "- Common actions: Run current cell and advance; insert above/below; delete; split/merge; move up/down.\n",
    "- Outputs: Text, plots, HTML, images, audio, and more are supported via rich display protocols.\n",
    "- Clearing output: Useful before committing to version control or sharing clean copies.\n",
    "- Checkpoints and autosave: Prevent data loss during interactive work.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Keyboard shortcuts and modes\n",
    "\n",
    "- Two modes: Command mode (manipulate cells) and Edit mode (edit content). Escape switches to command mode; Enter to edit.\n",
    "- Useful shortcuts (defaults): \n",
    "  - Run cell and advance: Shift+Enter\n",
    "  - Run cell, don’t advance: Ctrl+Enter\n",
    "  - Insert cell above/below: A/B\n",
    "  - Delete cell: D, D\n",
    "  - Undo cell delete: Z\n",
    "  - Move cell up/down: K/J\n",
    "  - Toggle command/edit: Enter/Esc\n",
    "- Learn the shortcut help panel in your interface; productivity improves dramatically with a few key bindings.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Markdown for documentation\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use Markdown cells for headings, lists, code snippets, links, and images.\n",
    "- Math: LaTeX-style expressions render as equations (inline and display).\n",
    "- Style your notebook to read like a report: introduce the problem, summarize methods, show results, and discuss conclusions.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Visualization and rich outputs\n",
    "\n",
    "- Plotting: Libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly, Altair, Bokeh integrate seamlessly; outputs appear inline.\n",
    "- Rich media: Display HTML, Markdown, SVG, images, audio, and video using display utilities.\n",
    "- Multiple outputs per cell: Cells can display several outputs; consider clarity and notebook size.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Interactivity with widgets\n",
    "\n",
    "- ipywidgets provides sliders, dropdowns, buttons, and more for interactive controls.\n",
    "- Useful for exploratory analysis and demos. They run in the browser, with code executed on the Python kernel.\n",
    "- Parameter exploration: Build simple UIs to adjust parameters and instantly update plots or results.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Magics and shell integration (IPython features)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Shell escapes: Prefix with ! to run a shell command (e.g., !ls). Use with care for portability and security.\n",
    "- Help and introspection: Append ? or ?? to objects to view docstrings and source when available.\n",
    "- Line magics (%something) and cell magics (%%something) provide convenience features while staying in Python.\n",
    "- Examples: %time and %timeit (timing), %matplotlib inline (plotting), %load_ext autoreload and %autoreload 2 (auto-reload modules), %%bash to run shell commands in a cell.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Environments and kernels\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each kernel is tied to a language/runtime and often to a specific environment (conda env or virtualenv).\n",
    "- Create a kernel per environment so notebooks run with the right package versions.\n",
    "- Tools: ipykernel (Python). Install kernels in environments and select them from the UI.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Debugging and profiling\n",
    "\n",
    "- Debugging: In Python, use %debug after an exception to open a post-mortem debugger. JupyterLab supports an integrated debugger with ipykernel 6+ and compatible libraries.\n",
    "- Profiling: %time, %timeit, and %prun help measure performance. Line-profiler and memory-profiler have magics once installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Extensions and the broader ecosystem\n",
    "\n",
    "- JupyterLab extensions: Themes, git integration, variable inspectors, table viewers, and more.\n",
    "- nbconvert: Programmatically convert notebooks to HTML, PDF, slides, or scripts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical workflow patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exploration: Load data, explore, visualize, and iterate quickly, capturing insights in Markdown.\n",
    "- Refactoring: Move stable logic into Python modules; keep the notebook lean and narrative-focused.\n",
    "- Reporting: Clean outputs, add a summary, and export to HTML or PDF for stakeholders.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Common pitfalls and how to avoid them\n",
    "\n",
    "- Out-of-order execution: Leads to hidden state and confusing results. Regularly restart and run all.\n",
    "- Bloated files: Many large outputs or embedded images make notebooks heavy. Clear or limit outputs and avoid storing big data inside.\n",
    "- Environment drift: Results change as dependencies evolve. Pin versions and capture environments.\n",
    "- Mixing exploratory and production code: Keep notebooks for exploration and reporting, move reusable logic into modules, and add tests outside the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Summary - Quick mental model\n",
    "\n",
    "- Notebook: a literate computing document of cells.\n",
    "- Kernel: the live process that runs your code.\n",
    "- Server/UI: the browser-based editor that talks to the kernel.\n",
    "- Ecosystem: tools for visualization, interactivity, conversion, deployment, and scaling."

       "## Explanation of the Python Code\n",
       "\n",
       "This Python code estimates the value of Pi using the Monte Carlo method. Here's a breakdown:\n",
       "\n",
       "**1. Imports:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   `import math`: Although not directly used in this simplified version, it's generally good practice to import the `math` module when dealing with mathematical calculations.\n",
       "*   `import random`: This module is essential for generating random numbers, which are the core of the Monte Carlo simulation.\n",
       "\n",
       "**2. `compute_pi_low_precision()` Function:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **Monte Carlo Method:**  This function uses the Monte Carlo method, a technique that relies on random sampling to obtain numerical results. In this case, it's used to approximate Pi.\n",
       "*   **`iterations = 10000`:**  This line sets the number of random points that will be generated. A smaller number of iterations results in lower precision but faster computation.\n",
       "*   **`inside_circle = 0`:** This variable is a counter that keeps track of how many random points fall *inside* a unit circle (a circle with radius 1 centered at the origin).\n",
       "*   **`for _ in range(iterations):`:** This loop iterates `iterations` (10000) times, generating a new random point in each iteration.\n",
       "*   **`x = random.uniform(-1, 1)` and `y = random.uniform(-1, 1)`:**  These lines generate random floating-point numbers between -1 and 1 for the x and y coordinates of a point. This effectively creates points within a square with sides of length 2 centered at the origin.\n",
       "*   **`if x*x + y*y <= 1:`:** This is the core of the Monte Carlo estimation.  It checks if the randomly generated point (x, y) lies inside the unit circle. The equation `x² + y² <= 1` represents the condition for a point to be inside the unit circle.\n",
       "*   **`inside_circle += 1`:** If the point (x, y) is inside the unit circle, the `inside_circle` counter is incremented.\n",
       "*   **`pi_estimate = 4 * inside_circle / iterations`:** After generating all the random points, the value of Pi is estimated using this formula. This formula is derived from the ratio of the area of the circle to the area of the enclosing square.\n",
       "*   **`return round(pi_estimate, 2)`:** The estimated value of Pi is rounded to two decimal places using the `round()` function, and then returned.\n",
       "\n",
       "**3. Main Execution Block:**\n",
       "\n",
       "*   **`result = compute_pi_low_precision()`:**  This line calls the `compute_pi_low_precision()` function and stores the returned estimated value of Pi in the `result` variable.\n",
       "*   **`print(f\"Pi (low precision): 3.16\")`:** This line prints the estimated value of Pi to the console. **Important Note:** The code *always* prints `3.16` regardless of the value computed by the function. This is likely an oversight or a deliberate simplification for demonstration purposes. It doesn't use the `result` variable which stores the computed pi estimate.\n",
       "\n",
       "**In essence, the code simulates throwing darts at a square board with a circle inscribed within it.  The ratio of darts that land inside the circle to the total number of darts thrown approximates the ratio of the circle's area to the square's area, allowing us to estimate Pi.**"
