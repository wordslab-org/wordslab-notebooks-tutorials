    "Several features of code server and the Continue.dev extension require that you access the web UI in a trusted context:\n",
    "- via a secure https connection\n",
    "- via localhost / 127.0.0.1\n",
    "\n",
    "If you don't do this, you will get an error message at the first connection, and the dialog of the Continue.dev extension will not be displayed: you can click on the + icon to launch a dialog or try to use the keyboard shortcuts, and nothing will happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "The different options are described here : https://coder.com/docs/code-server/guide#expose-code-server\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 1: use local access only\n",
    "\n",
    "If you only use one local machine, and always access vscode server from localhost, everything will work fine out of the box.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Option 2: use self-signed certificates\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On your main client machine, use mkcert (https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert) to create a new root certificate authority\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- on the first machine, locate the mkcert Root CA files:\n",
    "  - macOS/Linux: ~/.local/share/mkcert\n",
    "  - Windows: C:\\Users\\<your-username>\\AppData\\Local\\mkcert\n",
    "- copy the following two files to the other client machines\n",
    "  - rootCA.pem\n",
    "  - rootCA-key.pem (only needed if you want to generate more certificates on Machine B)\n",
    "- on the other machines, place the copied files in the appropriate directory and run: \"mkcert -install\"\n",
    "\n",
    "3. On your main client machine, generate a self-signed certificate for the server machine\n",
    "\n",
    "If you rent machines on Jarvislabs or Runpod, you can do it once and for all:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "mkcert \"*.proxy.runpod.net\" \"*.notebooks.jarvislabs.net\" localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If you use local machines ou rent machines on Vast, you need to create a certificate for each IP adress:\n",

    "```\n",
    "mkcert 192.168.1.197 localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1\n",
    "mkcert 142.115.158.140 localhost 127.0.0.1 ::1\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. On each of your server machines, start code server with the self generated certificate:\n",
    "\n",
    "- copy the certificate and its key (2 files) in the directory: \\$WORDSLAB_WORKSPACE/.codeserver\n",
    "- update code-server launch command in the script \\$WORDSLAB_HOME/wordslab-notebooks/linux/4_start-wordslab-notebooks.sh: \n",

    "### Option 3: use ssh tunneling / port forwarding\n",
    "\n",
    "https://coder.com/docs/code-server/guide#port-forwarding-via-ssh\n",
    "\n",
    "1. On your main client machine, generate a SSL key\n",
