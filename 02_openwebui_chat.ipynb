    "> Translated from the article [**Mastering the Art of Giving Instructions to Generative AI Solutions**](https://www.francenum.gouv.fr/guides-et-conseils/intelligence-artificielle/generation-de-contenus-texte-image-son-video/comment-0) by **Orlane Berlaud** on francenum.gouv.fr.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like any colleague, **generative AI requires clear and precise instructions** (prompts) to deliver results that meet expectations: this is known as **prompt engineering**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mastering the creation of prompts is emerging as a key skill. To help you, this guide presents the essential techniques for crafting effective prompts.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Are the Fundamentals of a Successful Prompt?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Who hasn’t been frustrated by an AI response that completely misses the mark? We’ve all experienced that moment of exasperation where we think, *\"That’s not at all what I wanted!\"* Vague instructions inevitably lead to disappointing results. Just like a colleague working without clear guidelines, AI will stray from your initial expectations without detailed instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Yet, with a few simple principles, we can improve the quality of our interactions with AI.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Define What You Want to Achieve**\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"What is well conceived is clearly expressed,\"* said Nicolas Boileau, a famous 17th-century author. The first step, even before typing your prompt, is to precisely define your expectations. It’s like planning a trip, you wouldn’t leave without knowing your destination. Similarly, take the time to answer a few questions:\n",
    "- What goal do I want to achieve?\n",
    "- What type of result am I expecting?\n",
    "- Who will read or use this content?\n",
    "\n",
    "This preliminary reflection, which only takes a few seconds, can save you time!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Formulate Precise and Structured Instructions**\n",
    "\n",
    "Once your objectives are clear, crafting your prompt becomes almost natural. Let’s take a concrete example to understand the importance of precise and structured instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Imagine you’re interested in climate change. A basic request might be:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Tell me about climate change.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "With this phrasing, you risk getting a generic, encyclopedia-like response that’s not very useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you rephrase your instructions as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Explain the three main impacts of climate change on agriculture in France, using recent data and adopting a pedagogical tone,\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "the response will be much more aligned to your expectations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **What Are the Elements of an Effective Prompt?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now that we’ve covered the basics of a good prompt, let’s review the steps to build instructions that will help you achieve the desired results. Keep in mind that not all these elements are mandatory, and you’re free to adapt these suggestions based on your goals.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Define the Action/Objective**\n",
    "\n",
    "This step involves giving the AI a concrete task to perform. A well-formulated action leaves no room for doubt. Here are some examples of actions you can ask the AI to perform:\n",
    "- In marketing? Ask it to analyze your market and produce a detailed report.\n",
    "- Managing an online store? The AI can write product descriptions that encourage purchases.\n",
    "- Running social media? It can build a content calendar.\n",
    "- Writing a blog? It can suggest relevant article topics for your audience.\n",
    "- Launching a new product? It can prepare a compelling sales pitch.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to be direct and precise in your request. The clearer you are about the desired action, the better the AI can provide exactly what you need.\n",
    "\n",
    "It’s like a cooking recipe. You wouldn’t just say *\"make me something to eat,\"* but rather *\"prepare a quiche Lorraine for six people.\"* It’s the same logic with AI!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Proceed Step by Step**\n",
    "\n",
    "What often makes the difference in AI-generated responses is the step-by-step approach. If we stick with the cooking analogy, the more detailed the instructions, the better the dish will turn out.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of making a broad request and hoping the AI understands your expectations, give it a roadmap.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you’re a marketing manager developing a new strategy, you could structure your request like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Develop a marketing strategy following this plan:*\n",
    "1. *First, create a profile of our ideal customer;*\n",
    "2. *Then, analyze our competitors: their strengths and weaknesses;*\n",
    "3. *Next, choose the most suitable marketing channels;*\n",
    "4. *Finally, prepare messages that hit the mark.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "By proceeding this way, the AI can address each point one by one and provide a well-organized response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Create a Persona**\n",
    "\n",
    "A persona is a semi-fictional character (or avatar) that embodies a type of person. Using a persona allows you to assign a role to the AI. This way, the responses will be much more precise than a simple command, as the AI will adopt the mindset of an expert in the field.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you’re launching a new perfume and need an advertising strategy, you could phrase your request like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"You are a renowned art director with 30 years of experience in advertising. I’d like you to brainstorm 10 advertising concepts for a perfume brand.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "By doing this, the AI will adopt the tone, vocabulary, and expertise specific to the subject.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Use Examples and Templates**\n",
    "\n",
    "In interactions with AI, the principle of mimicry plays a crucial role. By providing concrete examples, we create a model that the AI will seek to replicate, like a mirror reflecting the structure and style presented. This could be a course document, a commercial brochure, a thesis, a pitch, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Through this mechanism of replication, the AI draws direct inspiration from the provided model. It adopts not only the structure and style but also the level of precision used in the example. This ability to \"mimic\" a given format ensures responses aligned with your expectations while preserving the relevance of the content.\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing an example or template helps define the expected output format. In practice, you provide a skeleton for your AI to follow the same model with areas to fill in.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- For commercial emails, share a message that has already proven effective.\n",
    "- For job descriptions, show your company’s standard format.\n",
    "- For a training program, present the structure of an existing module.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Specify the Context**\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike human exchanges, where implicit understanding and subtext are part of communication, AI cannot read between the lines or access unexpressed thoughts. It only analyzes and processes the information we explicitly provide. Without this context, it’s like an interlocutor trying to answer questions in the dark, unaware of the circumstances or stakes.\n",
    "\n",
    "To establish the most complete context possible, several dimensions must be defined:\n",
    "- **Company characteristics and environment:** Describe its size, organizational structure, specific industry, and market position. Company culture and customer base are also fundamental elements.\n",
    "- **Your position within the organization:** Your role, hierarchical level, the team you manage (if applicable), and your relationships with different levels of the company.\n",
    "- **The current project or mission:** Specify the nature of the project/mission, the objectives, and the constraints you face. Include the resources available and deadlines to meet.\n",
    "- **The stakes:** The results you aim to achieve, the expected impact on the organization as a whole, the identification of stakeholders, and potential risks that could affect the project’s success.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### **Set Constraints**\n",
    "\n",
    "Defining constraints helps set limits for the AI to guide it. Constraints can be integrated in two ways:\n",
    "- Directly into your main request.\n",
    "- In a dedicated section that precisely lists all the rules to follow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a concrete example: You want to create a social media post. You could phrase your request like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "*\"Write a compelling message about the benefits of sports in under 280 characters, without using hashtags, with a dynamic and inspiring tone.\"*\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Use Markdown for format your prompts**\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tip:** Use Markdown to structure your instructions well.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an [introduction to the Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/cheat-sheet/).\n",
    "\n",
    "To formulate our prompt, rely on the Markdown format, which helps create well-structured, easy-to-read, and shareable documents while remaining simple to write and maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown, allows you to enrich the text structure. Indeed, generative AI text tools, which only consider plain text during chat interactions, struggle to interpret structural and formatting elements.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Markdown, it’s easy to maintain a clear hierarchy using headings and subheadings, highlight key information with lists or bold text, and create distinct sections with separators (---) to guide the AI in identifying priorities and important parts of the text.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Expert Advice**\n",
    "\n",
    "To optimize your interactions with AI, consider regularly starting new chats. This prevents the AI from forgetting the conversation context (which it tends to do) and from providing imprecise responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of submitting complex requests all at once, we also recommend breaking them down into well-defined steps! For example, if you want to summarize a document and translate it, the result will be more optimal if you do it in several iterations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Above all, always take the time to verify and adjust the generated content. This final step is essential to ensure quality results!\n",
    "\n",
    "Experiment! The techniques presented in this article are just a starting point. Adapt them, test them, and find what works best in your context. Each AI tool has its own quirks, and it’s through practice that you’ll develop your own method!\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Conclusion**\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that prompt engineering is evolving at the same pace as AI advancements. While mastering prompts requires practice and regular adjustments, it quickly becomes a reflex that transforms AI into a true work partner."

    "By default, Open WebUI does a simple and fast text extraction on the documents you insert in the conversation.\n",

    "If the documents have a complex layout on several columns, contain tables, formulas or images, this simple text extraction operation will not be good enough.\n",
    "\n",
    "You then need to start a more advanced document extraction service, and configure Open WebUI to use it when a document is downloaded.\n",
    "- advantages: much better preservation of the contents and of the semantic meaning of the document\n",
    "- drawbacks: much longer document processing delay, and several GB of additional VRAM used on your GPU\n",

    "To start a Docling server inside your virtual machine and configure Open WebUI to use it as a document processing service:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Open a Terminal in JupyterLab (see the tutorial 3)\n",
    "2. Execute the following command to set the value of the OPENWEBUI_START_DOCLING environment variable to \"yes\" in the wordslab-notebooks startup script\n",
